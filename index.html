<h2>Easily convert MKV files into iTunes (ipad and iPhone 4) compatible MP4 files.</h2>

<p>
Many people download videos from the Internet and or rip them from their DVD collection.  Often times these files are saved as MKV (Matroska Media Container.)  None of the iOS devices from Apple including the iPad and iPhone support the MKV video container.  iTunes won't touch it either.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of tutorials that show you how to encode your video from MKV to MP4.  The problem with this is that encoding HD video for a feature length movie could take hours.  Fortunately most MKV files use a .H264 track which can be extracted so that all you need to do is re-encode the audio which is either in AC3 or DTS format.

<p>
This script will transcode those files.
