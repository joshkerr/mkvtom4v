I found a few scripts and compiled them into this one script.  It identifies and extracts the video and audio.  It then encodes the audio into AAC and packages into a M4V container.\r\n\r\nUsage: mkvtom4v.sh\r\n\r\nThe script will process all files in the current folder.  You can use the script to create a watch folder.  Let OSX automatically process movie files using folder script actions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[2010-12-06: REVISION 2]\r\n\r\n[NEW] Now scans a given folder for all MKV's.  Processes everything.\r\n\r\n[FIXED] Would error out on ffmpeg when trying to convert certain AC3 files.\r\n\r\n[FIXED] Progress function on success would quit the script rather than go on to the next step.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
